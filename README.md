# Debian AD Join Script #

This script was created to simplify adding a debian system to Active Directory.  It started with [a blog post](http://www.alandmoore.com/blog/2015/05/06/joining-debian-8-to-active-directory/), and it seemed there was a need to improve it so I've created this github repository.

Please feel free to make pull requests to fix problems you encounter joining your AD.

## Goals ##

This script should:

- Join a base install of Debian Stable to Active Directory
- Allow domain logins
- Allow Domain Admins to use `sudo`

Additional features would be nice.
